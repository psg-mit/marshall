! Create a cam and piston system:

! The cam is an ellipse centered at the origin that rotates over time,
! with a circle with it's center along the positive x-axis and it's
! leftmost point touching the ellipse on the positive x-axis.

! NOTE: Quantifiers should be generalized to all a and b, but
! cannot because marshall doesn't all variables in foralls.
